* should it be /sharing only, can it be /xxx/sharing?

* how to define point of entry, eg reciever URL?

* in section "Creating a Ticket Sharing Agreement" text
  says "requester MUST include a X-Ticket-Sharing-Token",
  but example has no such header.

* Why content type of requests and responses is not 'text/x-json'?

* is access_key of agreement mutable?

* in section "Retrieving a Ticket Sharing Agreement"
  code for "Method Not Allowed" HTTP status is wrong.
  It should be 405, but it's 406.
